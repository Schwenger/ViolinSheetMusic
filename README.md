# Violin Sheet Music
This repository contains some sheet music for violin, engraved with [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/).

If you don't know LilyPond, check it out, it's by far the best sheet music engraver/typesetter I'm aware of.
Especially if you're familiary with LaTeX, you'll feel right at home.

# Engraving
After installing [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) just run `lilypond <filename>.ly` and wait for it to complete. Piece of cake.

# Disclaimer
I did not compose any of the music and I do not hold any rights for the pieces. Whenever possible, the author name will be attached to the sheet music.

Moreover, I am German. Some of the notation is language-specific, such as "o.H."/"u.H." which means upper/lower half of the bow. Similarly, parts in a major/minor scale are referred to as dur/moll, respectively.

Lastly, I'm fairly new to LilyPond, so I am certain there's a lot — and I mean *a lot* — of room for improvement. I'm always happy to receive some feedback.
